Manage Gift Sets/Baskets
==========================
The Manage Gift Sets or Basket feature allows a user to group articles together in a specified quantity and sells them as a package to the customer.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================

**Description:**        * This feature allows the retailer to manage a Bundle of Single Articles.
                          The advantage of a Bundle is in grouping complementary products for sale in a Gift Set of Basket.

**Related topics:**     * *Manage Displays*

**Application:**        * To create a bundle of products to form one product.
                        * The bundle is sold as an individual product to the customer.
                        * As a manufacturer/retailer the user can't increase the number of quantities in the bundle.
                        * *Example:*

                            A new dog owner may purchase a 'New Pet Dog Starter Kit' which includes a bag of food, a collar and a small bed.
