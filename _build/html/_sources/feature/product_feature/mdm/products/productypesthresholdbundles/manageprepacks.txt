Manage Prepacks
================
Manage Prepacks is a feature that allows a user to group together different products to create *Prepacks*, which are assembled offerings of individual products in various quantities that can be ordered by stores.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * It is a collection of single articles (*similar or dissimilar*), tied or wrapped up together as one.
                        * This feature creates *Threshold Bundle*, which is also known as *Loose bundle*.

**Related topics:**     *  :doc:`Manage Displays</feature/product_feature/mdm/products/productypesthresholdbundles/managedisplays>`

**Application:**        * A *Loose bundle* or *Combination of Products* may help retailers to increase the sales of products.
                        * This type of bundle can be used during stock clearance, where the retailer can add a single item in multiple quantities or can sell the bundle at a discounted price.
                        * *Example:*

                            A *Retailer* puts together a prepack of *3 shampoos* for 80 bucks or a prepack of *shampoo, conditioner, and face wash* for 100 bucks.
                            These products can be sold either as a combo or individual items.
