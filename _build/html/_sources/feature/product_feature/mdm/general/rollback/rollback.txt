Rollback
========

The Rollback feature allows a user to switch (or to revert) to a previous version of a product in the system.

===================  =================================================================================================================================================================

**Description:**          * The rollback allows a user to go back to any version if the user/supplier wishes to revert back to previous changes.
                          * This feature can be accessed from within a product's page under the 'Timeline' tab.

**Related topics:**       * :doc:`Manage Virtual Catalogs </feature/product_feature/mdm/products/catalogmanagementvirtualproductcatalogs/managevirtualcatalogs>`
                          * :doc:`Product Classifications </feature/product_feature/mdm/governance/classificationandcategorization/improveproductclassifications>`
                          * :doc:`Compare Product Revisions </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/timelineandhistory/compareproductrevisions>`

**Application:**          * The Rollback feature is used to switch back to a desired version of a product.
                          * This is an enhancement to the basic ‘Rollback’ feature, it allows the user add or remove any
                            product relationship/context and return it back to the previous version.
                          * *Example:*

                              Supplier can add commercial text in the 'description' for Toblerone Chocolates during Holiday season.
                              Once the season is over, he can rollback to the  original description version.
