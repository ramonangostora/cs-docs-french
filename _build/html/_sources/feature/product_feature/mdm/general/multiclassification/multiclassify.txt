Multi-classify Objects
=======================

The Multi-classify Objects feature provides users the ability to add multiple classes to a product.
This enables better categorization of products as well as inheritance of relevant properties and attributes.


===================     =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Terms:**          * **Nature Class:** A class that defines the base type of product. This product type is specific to how the product should behave in the Contentserv software. Nature Classes could include *Single Article, Product, Bundle,* or other custom-made product types.
                        * **Attribution Class:** A class that adds specific attributes to the product it is assigned to. For example, a *Mobile Phone* class may add attributes for *Screen Size, Memory Size, Operating System,* etc.

**Description:**        * To multi-classify the product, we add multiple attribution classes to the product in addition to the single Nature Class. Attribution classes contain detailed descriptive properties for the product.
                        * The user is able to define the product further by adding properties based on different attribution classes.
                        * Classifying a product with classes aids in finding that feature as well as giving the product access to class-specific sets of attributes and properties.

**Application:**        * Attribution classes, which are also known as *Non-nature* classes, contain more detailed information about the products. The *Nature* class would only have general properties.
                        * The attribution class would define the product more in detail.
                        * *Example:*

															For an energy drink, the nature class *Single Article* would contain generic properties for the product,
															whereas an attribution class, *Beverages* would give details regarding beverages such as *volume and can size*.
															As for another class, *Energy Drinks*, it would give properties such as *nutrition contents and caffeine contents*.
