Standardize Product Definitions
================================
Standardize Product Definitions is a data governance feature that standardizes the product definitions, which results to improved consistency of product definitions in the system.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * Standardization and Normalization take into consideration various errors that may occur during data entry and introduce appropriate measures to correct it.
                          With this feature, the user is able to normalize different values entered for a particular value.
                        * A rule can be defined to normalize different values entered for the articles.
                        * Within multiple tags/attributes, there is an **'OR'** condition while for multiple tags/attributes, there is an **'AND'** condition.

                        * :doc:`Remedy Quality Issues </feature/product_feature/mdm/governance/dataremediation/remedyqualityissues>`

**Application:**        * Rules can be made to normalize or standardize a tag based on certain attributes for the product.
                        * There can be certain attributes, whose values are based on the selection of tag or attribute contents.
                        * *Example:*

                            The attributes for *Contents* in any food product will contain the information about the ingredients.
                            A tag needs to be normalized based on allergen information like *Contains Lactose* or *Contains Nuts*.
