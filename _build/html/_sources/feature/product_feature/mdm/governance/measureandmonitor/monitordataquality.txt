Monitor Data Quality
=====================
The Monitor Data Quality is a data governance feature that monitors the quality of the data in the catalog.
This feature helps define the products better and takes corrective actions to maintain good quality of data.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * All set rules regarding *Accuracy, Completeness, Conformity, and Uniqueness* are monitored using this feature.
                        * The *Dashboard* and *Graphical View* display the results as per data in the system.
                        * The results show a combination of all the Data Quality measures: *Accuracy, Completeness, Conformity and Uniqueness*. These measures are displayed in percentage format.
                        * The users/suppliers can have a detailed view of all the products in a report that explores the quality issues.

**Application:**        * Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs *(Key Performance Indicators)* relevant to a particular objective or business process.
                        * These reports help a user understand the products in the system and if there are any errors in them.
                          Also, a user is presented with a precise and accurate view of the data in the system with respect to *Data Quality*.
                        * A user can see all the set rules together in a single graph.
                        * *Example:*

                            Supplier A has about 1000 products in the system and few of them have incomplete data.
                            The supplier will be able to track the same with the help of graphs on the *Dashboard* so the supplier can properly take corrective actions.
