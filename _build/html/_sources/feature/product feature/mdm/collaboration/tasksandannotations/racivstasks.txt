RACI-VS Tasks
==============
The RACI-VS Tasks is a feature that allows users to create a task and assign roles that will check each stage of the task until it is completed and signed off.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * This feature allows users to create tasks and assign the checking of the task to users using different roles.
                        * The role assigned to a user can be one of the following: *Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed, Verifier, and Sign off*.
                          These roles have different levels of rights and permissions in the system.
                          The life cycle of a task also depends on the decision of the user assigned to a specific role.

**Related Topic:**      * *Tasks and Annotations*
                        * *Task Dashboard*
                        * *Public/Private Tasks*

**Application:**        * The review and approval of tasks can be assigned to the roles (roles may then be assigned to users).
                          Each role will have its set of rights and permissions in the system.
                          The task flow explains the various stages of a task starting from *Planned* (initial status) until *Signed off*.
                          It also shows the different roles in charge of validation before the task is endorsed to the next step.
                          Refer to the *Task Flow* image in the *How to do* section.

|
|

  #. The user who created the task, by default, is the **Accountable** user. The **Accountable** user can change the task from *Planned* to the *Ready* state.

  |
  |

  #. Once in the *Ready* state, the **Responsible** user acknowledges the task and sets it to either *Declined* or *In Progress*.

  .. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/racivstasks_oncethereadystate.PNG
  |
  |

  #. When the task is completed by the **Accountable** user, the **Responsible** user acknowledges and sets the status to *Done*.

  .. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/racivstasks_whenthetaskiscompleted.PNG
  |
  |

  #. Once the status is *Done*, the **Verifier** checks the completion of the task and can set the status back to *In Progress*. If there are no changes, the **Verifier** endorses it to *Verified* status.

  .. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/racivstasks_oncethestatusisdone.PNG
  |
  |

  #. If the **Verifier** sets it back to *In Progress*, the **Accountable** user will have to ensure the completion of the task again so that the **Responsible** user can set it to *Done* and then, the **Verifier** will validate. If the status is set to *Verified*, move to the next step.

  .. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/racivstasks_iftheverifiersetsitback.PNG
  |
  |

  #. Once *Verified*, the **Sign-off** user can set it back to *In Progress* wherein the cycle will restart. If everything is good, the **Sign-off** user can set it to *Signed off*.

  #. If *Signed off*, the final status will look like the image shown below:
