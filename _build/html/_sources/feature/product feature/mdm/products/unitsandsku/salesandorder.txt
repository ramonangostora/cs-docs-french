Manage Sales and Order Units
============================


Manage Sales and Order Units lets you tag various quantity units as sales or order units.


===================     =============================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * **Base unit** is the smallest measurement unit that cannot be divided further or the item itself in its single quantity.
                          (Example: *a single can of Red Bull)*
                        * **Sales unit** is any item that is sellable to the customer. (Example: *a single can of Red Bull, a pack of 24 Red Bull cans, and minced meat*)
                        * **Order unit** can be tagged to products that are in large quantity. These items are usually not intended to be sold to an end customer.
                          These units are usually tagged to products a retailer orders from the wholesaler or manufacturer.
                          (Example: *a box or 30 beer bottles, a large box of vegetables)*
                        * Some products can be classified as sales unit and order unit.

**Related topics:**     * *Manage Individual Articles*

**Application:**        * Use these tags to distinguish whether an article is a sales unit or an order unit.
                        * A base unit is tagged to the single item. A base unit article is usually tagged as a sales unit.
                          (Example: *For a carton of Red Bull cans, the base unit is a single Red Bull can)*
                        * *Example:*

                            Retailer orders in bulk and sells the pieces to the customer so it is important to keep track whether an item is a sales unit, base unit, or order unit.
