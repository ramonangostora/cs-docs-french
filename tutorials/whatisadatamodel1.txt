What is a Data Model?
======================

Products in the real world can be described in various ways. In real life we may say a tv has dimensions, colours and a supplier. This is all data that relates to the product. When we say Data Model we are talking about the way we structure this information so that it accurately reflects reality while also capturing how different entities in Contentsphere (products, images, audio, colour) relate to one another.


**Example:**

    A product, such as a *T-Shirt*, inherently has a Data Model that defines it. At the highest level, it is given a *Nature Class*, which could be *Product*.
    This Product class allows the *T-Shirt* to have variants.  At this level, the *T-Shirt* describes the design but is not a sellable item.

    The Data Model for your *T-Shirt* also has Non-Nature/Attribution classes such as *'Clothing'*.
    The *Clothing* Attribution Class attaches properties such as fabric and color to the *T-Shirt* product.
    The Taxonomy is used to add the *T-Shirt* product into a broader store classification or a category system.
