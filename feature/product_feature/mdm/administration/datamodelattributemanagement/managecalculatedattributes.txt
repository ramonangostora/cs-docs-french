Manage Calculated Attributes
=============================

The Manage Calculated Attributes is a feature that allows attributes to be calculated by using a formula that takes values from other attributes.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * This feature allows attributes to be calculated. A calculated attribute is a read-only field whose value is based on a specified formula that takes values
                          from other defined attributes.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage Different Types of Attributes </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/datamodelattributemanagement/managedifferenttypesofattributes>`

**Application:**        * The feature will allow an administrator to set up calculations that will result in a new attribute using the values from other defined attributes.
                        * *Example:*

                            An administrator sets up an attribute that will calculate the total number of bottles given that a user only defines the number of boxes.
                            In a box, there are 10 bottles. The calculated attribute will then show the total number of bottles depending on the value set for the number of boxes
                            multiplied by 10.
