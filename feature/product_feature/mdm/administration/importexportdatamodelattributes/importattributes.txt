Import Attributes
==================
The Import Attributes is a feature that allows importing of attribute definitions and data so that multiple attributes can be created in one go.


===================     =========================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Attribute:** A data field which describes a product, can also use 'property'.

**Description:**        * It allows the import of a document with a list of different types of attributes: *HTML, Text, Number, Price, Concatenated, Measurement, Date, and Standard Attribute*.
                        * It also allows a user to import attributes in bulk instead of creating them one by one, manually.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage Different Types of Attributes </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/datamodelattributemanagement/managedifferenttypesofattributes>`
                        * :doc:`Export Attributes </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/importexportdatamodelattributes/exportattributes>`

**Application:**        * The feature allows a user to import the attributes in bulk, thereby, saving a lot of time.
                          It also reduces manual work because a user does not have to create one attribute at a time.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Supplier A* has *Products X, Y and Z* with 25 attributes each. Rather than inputting all these attributes one by one in the system,
                            *Supplier A* can collate all information in one document and import it using this feature.
