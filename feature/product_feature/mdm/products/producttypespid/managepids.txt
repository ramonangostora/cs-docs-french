Manage PIDs
============
Manage PIDs lets you define articles that are a combination of other individual articles.


===================     =============================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * PID is a virtual product that groups a product line related to a brand.
                        * By managing PIDs, the related products of a seller or a brand can be grouped in one place.

**Related topics:**     * *Embedded Variants within Context*
                        * *Manage Data Transfer*

**Application:**        * Form a group of related products.
                        * Use PIDs for a set of similar products that differ in one or two properties.
                        * *Example:*

                            Let's take for instance, Maggi. The different flavors of Maggi (Chicken, Cheese, Vegetable) can be brought under one virtual product.
                            As a result, a customer or a retailer can view a product line as virtual products.
