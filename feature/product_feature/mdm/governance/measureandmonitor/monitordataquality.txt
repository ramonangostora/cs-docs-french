Monitor Data Quality
=====================
The Monitor Data Quality is a data governance feature that monitors the quality of the data in the catalog. This feature better defines the products and takes corrective actions to maintain quality.

===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================

**Description:**        * All the set rules regarding *Accuracy, Completeness, Conformity and Uniqueness* are monitored here.
                        * The *Dashboard* and *Graphical View* display the results as per data in the system.
                        * The result shows a combination of all the Data Quality measures: *Accuracy, Completeness, Conformity and Uniqueness*. These are displayed in a percentage format.
                        * The users/suppliers can have a detailed view of all the products in a report that also explores the quality issues.

**Application:**        * Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process.
                        * These reports help a user understand the products in the system and if there are any errors in them.
                          Also, a user has presented a precise and accurate view of the data in the system with respect to Data Quality.
                          Also, a user is presented with a precise and accurate view of the data in the system with respect to *Data Quality*.
                        * A user can see all the set rules together in a single graph.
                        * *Example:*

                            Supplier A has about 1000 products in the system and few of them have incomplete data.

                            The supplier will be able to track the same with the help of graphs on the *Dashboard* so the supplier can properly take corrective actions.
