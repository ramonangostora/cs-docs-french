**Description:**        * Individual articles can have different units of measure such as a carton, can, box, cassette, cartridge, pounds, and kilograms.
                          Therefore, handling the products in various units of measure is necessary for both retailers and wholesalers.
                        * Being able to track the units in a tabular form allows for a more efficient handling operation.

**Related topics:**     * *Manage Sales and Order Units*

**Application:**        * Enable the system to handle not only multiple units but also similar units with different meanings.
                        * *Example:*

                            Let's take for instance a can of the energy drink "Red Bull", which is made available in its base unit (1 can), a box of 30, a carton of 35 and so on.
                            It is important for the retailer to have the capability to handle these units that are of different quantities.
